# Project-Euler


This project contains many files related to Project Euler problems. Mainly problem solutions. Here's an overview of the folders, and what they contain.

 * input - files used as input to many Project Euler problems
 * Python - full solutions w/comments to problems written in Python
 * Haskell - full solutions to problems written in Haskell
 * Scheme - full solutions to problems written in Scheme

Any files outside of these specific folders are not necessarily complete, commented or readable. They may also be incredibly slow, even if they do give the right answer.

Mainly it contains solutions to problems. However, these are not all complete. Some of them might also freeze your computer, so use with care. At some point in the future I plan to create solutions in several different languages for many of the problems, and to properly comment and name my code (currently, it's a mess), but I haven't done so yet.
